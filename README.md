# iRecipe
Aiming to solve an every-day problem, iRecipe takes a list of ingredients/groceries that the client has and gives suggestions on food that can be made with the given ingredients, as well as recipes to their favorite dishes. This eliminates the daily question of what to eat, and gives you tailored results based on the groceries you already own.
